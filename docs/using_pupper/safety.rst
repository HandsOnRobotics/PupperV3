Safety features
----------------
- **No exposed pinch points or sharp edges:** Locations where moving parts contact each other (pinch points) are covered in shrouds to prevent injury. All edges are chamfered or fileted. 
- **Protected battery:** Battery is protected in a rugged shell designed for harsh environments
- **Limited force:** Motor torque is limited and joints are compliant to limit the force robot can exert against a person
- **Accessible emergency stop:** Pupper can be turned off immediately by pressing the emergency stop (E-STOP) switch on its back.
- **Small and lightweight:** Compared to other robot quadrupeds, Pupper's small size and weight greatly reduce risk to people.

Human safety
-------------
Please observe the following advisories.

- **Do not touch moving robot:** Avoid touching Pupper while it is moving, especially near the legs, to avoid injury with moving parts. 
- **Operate on suitable surfaces:** The robot should not be placed on elevated surfaces where it could fall in order to prevent injury to people and the robot.
- **Avoid touching motors:** Avoid touching the motors (black metal circular objects at the joints), because they can reach high temperatures if Pupper has been running for a long time and can burn the skin if touched for an extended period of time. 
- **Supervise use around children:** Please supervise children at all times when they are interacting with Pupper and prevent children from touching the robot while it is moving. 


Robot safety 
-------------
- **Lift only from the handle:** While it is tempting to lift Pupper by the cables, doing so will likely damage the wiring and cause the robot to cease functioning. Only lift Pupper from the attached flexible plastic handle.
- **Limit extended exertion:** If run for a long time or carrying a heavy payload, for example, Pupper's motors can overheat and cause permanent damage to the motor windings.

Emergency shutdown
--------------------
- Press the E-STOP switch on Pupper's backpack to immediately kill power to the robot
