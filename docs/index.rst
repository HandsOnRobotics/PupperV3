Robotics & AI learning platform
********************************
Developed over several years of course instruction at Stanford University, our hands-on labs and curriculum offer comprehensive instruction in robotics and AI. Students learn foundational topics such as motor control and kinematics, as well as bleeding-edge subjects like visual reinforcement learning and LLM-powered autonomous agency.

Your robot friend
*******************
With the power of VLMs like ChatGPT, Pupper can listen and respond to you! Cameras, microphones, and proprioception enable Pupper to sense its environment. Speakers, a high resolution screen, expressive ears, and agile body enable Pupper to express its feelings through voice and motion.
