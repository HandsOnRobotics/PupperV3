Robotics & AI learning platform
********************************
Having refined our hands-on labs and curriculum over several years at Stanford University, you can learn robotics and AI from the fundamentals including motor control and kinematics to bleeding-edge topics like visual reinforcement learning and LLM-powered autonomous agency.

Your robot friend
*******************
With the power of VLMs like ChatGPT, Pupper can listen and respond to you! Cameras, microphones, and proprioception enable Pupper to sense its environment. Speakers, a high resolution screen, expressive ears, and agile body enable Pupper to express its feelings through voice and motion.
