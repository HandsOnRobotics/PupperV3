All of the parts can be bought directly from a vendor like 
Amazon or McMaster-Carr except for the 3D printed parts, custom PCBs, and actuators. 
You can either print the 3D printed parts yourself, or use an online service like Hubs.
The custom PCBs can be ordered using JLCPCB.
The custom actuators can be bought from SteadyWin.

Alternatively, you'll soon be able to buy a kit from `Hands-On Robotics <https://handsonrobotics.org/>`_.
